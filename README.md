# Ansible
Open-source automation tool for configuration management


Ansible is an open-source automation tool that helps you manage and configure multiple servers easily. It uses simple YAML files called playbooks to automate tasks like installing software, deploying applications, and managing system settings — all over SSH, without needing extra software on the servers.

📁 Structure:

    hosts — Inventory file listing managed servers(/etc/ansible/hosts)

    playbooks/ — Collection of reusable playbooks

    roles/ — Optional Ansible roles for organizing tasks

    group_vars/ — Group-specific variables
